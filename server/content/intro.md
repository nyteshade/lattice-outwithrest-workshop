# In with GraphQL and out with the REST

## Welcome

Welcome to my GraphQL Lattice workshop on how to build a small GraphQL
server to wrap and existing REST interface. GraphQL is all the rave when
it comes to APIs these days, and for good reason.

### What is GraphQL and what is Lattice?

|   |   |
|---|---|
|![GraphQL Logo](/graphql-logo.png)|Facebook describes GraphQL as a query language for APIs and a runtime for fulfilling those queries with your existing data. Lattice, on the other hand, is a new, lightweight, and slightly opinionated framework that works well with both the Facebook reference implementation of GraphQL as well as the server implementation provided by the Apollo Team.|

#### Async, Decorators and Classes, oh My!

That's right, Lattice uses all the new toys in the chest. Async/Await,
JavaScript ES7 Decorators and Classes. While functional programming indicates
strongly that classes are mutable and therefore bad, Lattice employs classes
in much the same way that React does; to provide a more compatible and feature
rich way of employing mix-ins to get everyone on the same page.

#### Documentation

Some documentation is provided here, but, for the most part, much of the
Lattice docs are Coming Soonâ„¢. The website is under going a revamp and, due
to the recent GraphQL Summit in San Francisco, was not made entirely ready
for consumption for this conference.

## Requirements and Assumptions

This workshop is intended to be either done as a group effort or as a live
coding exercise with results already being runnable in a final solution in
git.

It is assumed, should you wish to code along, that

 * You can use the `git` version control system
 * You have an editor of choice such as `Visual Studio Code`, `Atom`,
 `Sublime Text` or the like
 * Some ability to code in JavaScript, HTML and CSS
 * Experience with `NodeJS` and, preferably, `Express`

Extra bonus points are given for knowledge or familiarity with the following

 * `React`
 * `GraphQL`
 * `Apollo Server` or `Client` or both
 * REST endpoints
