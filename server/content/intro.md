# In with GraphQL and out with the REST

## Welcome

Welcome to my GraphQL Lattice workshop on how to build a small GraphQL
server to wrap and existing REST interface. GraphQL is all the rave when
it comes to APIs these days, and for good reason.

### What is GraphQL Lattice?

Lattice is a new, lightweight, slightly opinionated framework that works well with both the Facebook reference implementation of GraphQL as well as the
server implementation provided by the Apollo Team.

#### Async, Decorators and Classes, oh My!

That's right, Lattice uses all the new toys in the chest. Async/Await,
JavaScript ES7 Decorators and Classes. While functional programming indicates
strongly that classes are mutable and therefore bad, Lattice employs classes
in much the same way that React does; to provide a more compatible and feature
rich way of employing mix-ins to get everyone on the same page.

#### Documentation

Some documentation is provided here, but, for the most part, much of the
Lattice docs are Coming Soonâ„¢. The website is under going a revamp and, due
to the recent GraphQL Summit in San Francisco, was not made entirely ready
for consumption for this conference.
